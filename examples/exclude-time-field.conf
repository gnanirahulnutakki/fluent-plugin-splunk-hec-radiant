# Exclude Time Field Configuration (Issue #276)
# Shows how to control or exclude the time field in JSON output

# Example 1: Exclude time field completely
<match **>
  @type splunk_hec_radiant
  hec_host splunk.example.com
  hec_token YOUR_TOKEN_HERE

  # Set time_key to nil to exclude time field from JSON
  time_key nil

  # Your logs will NOT include a "time" field
</match>

# Example 2: Use custom timestamp field
<match **>
  @type splunk_hec_radiant
  hec_host splunk.example.com
  hec_token YOUR_TOKEN_HERE

  # Extract time from a custom field in your record
  time_key timestamp_field

  # This will use record["timestamp_field"] as the event time
  # No additional "time" field will be added
</match>

# Example 3: Exclude time but Splunk still gets proper timestamp
<match **>
  @type splunk_hec_radiant
  hec_host splunk.example.com
  hec_token YOUR_TOKEN_HERE

  # Don't include time in event JSON
  time_key nil

  # Splunk HEC still receives the timestamp in the HEC payload
  # It's sent in the top-level "time" field, not in "event" JSON
  # This is the recommended approach
</match>

# Example 4: Custom time format
<match **>
  @type splunk_hec_radiant
  hec_host splunk.example.com
  hec_token YOUR_TOKEN_HERE

  # Use existing timestamp field from your logs
  time_key @timestamp

  # If your logs already have a timestamp field, use it
  # Don't add a duplicate time field
</match>

# Example 5: Minimal JSON output (no extra fields)
<match **>
  @type splunk_hec_radiant
  hec_host splunk.example.com
  hec_token YOUR_TOKEN_HERE

  # Exclude time field
  time_key nil

  # Let Splunk handle all metadata via HEC headers
  # Your event JSON will only contain your log fields
  # Clean, minimal output
</match>
